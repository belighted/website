history:
  - date: 2008
    event: In 2008, on the university campus at Louvain-la-Neuve, Nicolas Jacobeus made his vision reality. He founded Belighted, a software development agency, to create innovative products that would delight users.
    image: ./about/history/nicolas.jpg
  - date: 2009
    event: From the start, Belighted embraced excellence in modern, efficient technologies like Ruby and its web framework Rails. Relentless focus on quality helped Belighted grow and attract like-minded talent.  The company grew to become a passionate team of software engineers, user experience specialists, and project managers.
    image: ./about/history/deloitte.png
  - date: 2013
    event: Belighted's growth got noticed. Belighted was nominated by Deloitte as one the 50 fastest growing technology firms in Benelux. We were one of the few services based businesses, and earned the 7th place among all Belgian participants. We made our first dent in the tech universe.
    image: ./about/history/grow.png
  - date: 2017
    event: Over the years, the experience we have gathered on hundreds of projects has resulted in a fine-tuned methodology to set our clientsâ€™ software products up for excellent performance. Strategy Workshop > Design Sprint > Software Development / MVP > Iteration on the product
  - date: 2018
    event: "Belighted is growing fast with a 50% increase in yearly revenue. We have added 9 new team members to the family. Each brings skills that will enrich our work for our clients and allow us to do more of what we love: creating and developing software products that grow your business. That's why we decided to recruit our very first marketer, an UX designer and other developers to continue our journey."
  - date: 2019
    event: "Belighted continues scaling at the same tempo. We are not even half-way through 2019 and we are already proud of our achievements so far: a brand new website, 3 new service lines (Code Review, UX audit & User Testing package) and we continue recruiting to become 25 Belighters by the end of the year."
