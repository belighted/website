  <p>You certainly have frequent inclusion of one or even more static pages in
  your projects ! In order to succeed in this task, you have several choices:
  either code it into pure html (meaning include the entire layout of your pages
  which require a lot of boring work) or even worst, you could create a resource
  and all the linked views.</p>

  <!--more-->

  <p>A better solution but quite time consuming is to implement a page controller which could handle all your static pages ( a bit like a cms) but this involve often a backend and a lot of other fancy things that you sometimes don’t need at all because these static pages are not going to change on a day to day basis and certainly because you’re a programmer and not a journalist !</p>

  <p>Hopefully, a new solution comes out of the woods ! The high voltage gem ! This allow you to create easilly static pages in your Rails application.</p>

  <p>Just include the gem in your Gemfile: <code>gem "high_voltage"</code>.</p>

  <p>Write your static pages and put them in the RAILS_ROOT/app/views/pages directory.</p>

  <p>For instance: <code>app/views/pages/about.html.erb</code></p>

  <p>and finally call it elsewhere: <code>link_to "About", page_path("about")</code></p>

  <p>You’re done !</p>

  <p>By the way using this gem allow you to keep all the ruby on rails magic stuffs you like and that are often so helpfull !</p>
