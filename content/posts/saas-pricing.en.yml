  <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Whether your SaaS solution is under development or in production, you are faced with a decision on what pricing structure to offer to your current and future customers. Here are number of different options available to you.</h3>

  <!--more-->

  <h3><span style="color: #85ccf6;"><strong>Flat rate pricing</strong></span></h3>

  <p><strong>A SaaS solution can be acquired through flat rate pricing:</strong> a single price for a single product, loaded a set of well-defined functionalities.</p>

  <p>This type of pricing has a number of similarities with the software license model used before the Cloud became available. However, monthly billing is generally offered today, which gives customers flexibility that they appreciate.</p>

  <h3><span style="color: #85ccf6;"><strong>Pay-per-use pricing</strong></span></h3>

  <p><strong>The more the customer uses your service, the higher your revenue. </strong></p>

  <p>This pricing plan, known in English as “Pay As You Go”, ties the cost of your SaaS solution to its use by the customer.</p>

  <p>For example, it is easy to record the number of transactions processed or the volume of data use in gigabytes and to invoice accordingly based on a rate schedule. This approach is not reserved only to companies offering infrastructure services or platforms and it is possible to adapt this pricing model to a number of applications, such as social media tools or on-line accounting apps.</p>

  <h3><span style="color: #85ccf6;"><strong>Tiered pricing</strong></span></h3>

  <p><strong>This basic model is used by many companies offering SaaS solutions.</strong></p>

  <p>Several pricing tiers are offered to the customer: each tier corresponds to a specific “flat” rate, providing a specific combination of features and functions.</p>

  <p>The number of flat rates offered varies widely: the most common approach is to offer 3&nbsp;pricing levels (low, medium, and high).</p>

  <p>Within this pricing arrangement, the most common approach is pricing based on features and functions. The lowest tier has all the core functionalities and the next two tiers each unlock a set of additional functions and features.</p>

  <h3><span style="color: #85ccf6;"><strong>Per-user pricing</strong></span></h3>

  <p><strong><img src="https://www.belighted.com/hs-fs/hubfs/survey-1.png?width=1071&amp;name=survey-1.png" alt="Per user Saas pricing" width="1071" style="width: 1071px;" srcset="https://www.belighted.com/hs-fs/hubfs/survey-1.png?width=536&amp;name=survey-1.png 536w, https://www.belighted.com/hs-fs/hubfs/survey-1.png?width=1071&amp;name=survey-1.png 1071w, https://www.belighted.com/hs-fs/hubfs/survey-1.png?width=1607&amp;name=survey-1.png 1607w, https://www.belighted.com/hs-fs/hubfs/survey-1.png?width=2142&amp;name=survey-1.png 2142w, https://www.belighted.com/hs-fs/hubfs/survey-1.png?width=2678&amp;name=survey-1.png 2678w, https://www.belighted.com/hs-fs/hubfs/survey-1.png?width=3213&amp;name=survey-1.png 3213w" sizes="(max-width: 1071px) 100vw, 1071px"></strong></p>

  <p><strong>Per-user pricing, or pricing per seat, is without a doubt the preferred SaaS pricing model.</strong> A single user pays a fixed monthly price. A second user doubles the price, a third triples the price, and so on.</p>

  <p>This simplicity allows customers to easily visualize the cost per seat and permits the SaaS undertaking to manage and accurately forecast its revenue.</p>

  <p>A variation on this pricing model, pricing by active user, allows the customer to enroll as many users a possible while being guaranteed that they will be billed only for active users.</p>

  <h3><span style="color: #85ccf6;"><strong>Freemium pricing&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>

  <p><strong>Under the freemium pricing model, a product is provided free of charge.&nbsp; The product can then be supplemented by a package of add-ons for which there is a charge.</strong></p>

  <p>Free entry-level pricing is limited to certain aspects: limited functionality: restricted capacity or a specific use authorization, such as one for in-house only that is not meant for customer management.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, users are encouraged to subscribe for one or more packages in order to benefit from a particular level of use of the SaaS solution.</p>
