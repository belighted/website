  <p>In case you haven’t noticed, Belighted is growing. Over the last few
  months, we’ve added several new team members. Each brings skills that will
  enrich our work for our clients and allow us to do more of what we love:
  creating and developing software products that grow your business.</p>

  <p>Our team setup is integral to <strong><a href="https://www.belighted.com/blog/product-development-methodology">how we produce</a></strong> our exceptional work. We are able to drive real successes for our clients because we begin with strategy, move through design and development, and then come back again to strategy as needed.</p>

  <p>We are pleased to introduce our latest team additions to you here.</p>

  <h3><!--more-->Full stack web developers</h3>

  <p>Amin, Atef, Brahim and Christophe are new to our team of full stack developers, bringing expertise in the core technologies we use, like Ruby on Rails.</p>

  <p>Also welcome junior web application developer Sarah, who brings with her a masters in communications and experience in video.</p>

  <h3>On the front end</h3>

  <p>Lucile joins us as a UI/UX designer, while Eddy ties it together as a graphic designer and front-end web developer.</p>

  <h3>Adding value with project management</h3>

  <p>One of the ways we add value beyond what most development agencies can is through exceptional project managers. We expect great things of our latest addition to the project management team, Sophie.</p>

  <h3>Our first marketing staff member</h3>

  <p>Please welcome our first in-house marketing team member, Dany. He holds a masters in business management with a major in marketing. He is coordinating our own marketing efforts as we ramp up this new area of expertise.</p>

  <p>As much as we value our clients, we take seriously the development of our team members. We have a lot of fun, we share in learning continuously, and we face all our challenges together, too. Our staff is fully bilingual in French and English, and many speak a third or fourth language as well.</p>
