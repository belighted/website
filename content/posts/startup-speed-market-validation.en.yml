  <p>If you’re going to get something wrong, it’s better to find out fast.</p>

  <p>With market validation built into your product roadmap, you can find out where you’re wrong faster.</p>

  <p>And you will get plenty wrong. In three years, if you’re still around, your startup may look completely different from what you imagined.</p>

  <p>This post is the last of our three-part series <strong><a href="https://www.belighted.com/blog/successful-startups-speed">demystifying startup failure</a></strong>. We talked first about the concept of speed in<strong> <a href="https://www.belighted.com/blog/startup-speed-talent">building your team</a></strong>. Then we dug into how <strong><a href="https://www.belighted.com/blog/startup-speed-focus">focus</a> </strong>can help you move faster. Today we’re going to look at the fundamental role market validation plays in speed.</p>

  <h2><!--more-->Market validation is more important than anything else</h2>

  <p>Market validation is more important than any other factor when you’re building a new product. It’s how you learn what people need, what they’ll pay for, and what they’ll continue to use -- so you know what to create.</p>

  <p>Because, frankly, what’s the point of creating something without confirming that people will buy it?</p>

  <h3>What is market validation?</h3>

  <p>When people say market validation, they’re usually talking about interviewing potential users, but startups can also use different channels to supplement that data. Some <strong><a href="https://getproductmarketfit.com/how-to-select-test-to-get-market-validation-for-new-product-or-business-idea/">ways to get feedback</a></strong> from your market might include:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Interviews</li>

  <li>Surveys</li>

  <li><strong>Landing page signups</strong></li>

  <li><strong>Crowdfunding</strong></li>

  <li>Pitching resellers</li>

  <li><strong>Testing changes with your users</strong></li>

  </ul>

  <p>Market validation lets you <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2010/02/how-much-process-is-too-much">maximize speed of learning</a></strong> at your startup through feedback from the market.</p>

  <h2>How market validation helps you fail faster</h2>

  <p>The number one <strong><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/">reason startups fail </a></strong>is that there’s no market need for the solution they built. Shocking, right?</p>

  <p>The last thing you want to do is pour everything into developing a new software product and then realize no one really cares about solving the problem enough to pay for it!</p>

  <p>Market validation must happen quickly, before committing to a roadmap. In the beginning, you will want to confirm some basics before you <strong><a href="https://www.belighted.com/design-sprint">design a prototype</a></strong> or write a line of code. Ideally it will continue to inform your product roadmap as you continue.</p>

  <h3>What things can you validate?</h3>

  <p>When you start out, you make assumptions. <strong>Without real data, you’re just guessing. Some of the fundamental things you want to know are:</strong></p>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>There really is a problem</strong></li>

  <ul>

  <li>How many other people think it’s a problem?</li>

  <li>How important is it to solve the problem?</li>

  </ul>

  </ul>

  <ul>

  <li><strong>Who the problem impacts the most</strong></li>

  <ul>

  <li>Is your target market really who you think it is?</li>

  <li>Who is willing to pay for a solution?</li>

  <li>Who else might be involved in the purchase?</li>

  <li>How can you reach them?</li>

  </ul>

  <li><strong>How to solve the problem</strong></li>

  <ul>

  <li>Will people actually use what you’re building?</li>

  <li>How can you make it easy to adopt?</li>

  </ul>

  <li><strong>How to charge for your solution</strong></li>

  <ul>

  <li>How much are people willing to pay?</li>

  <li>How does it make sense to pay? (E.g., subscription or one-time purchase, usage tiers or flat rate, etc.)</li>

  </ul>

  </ul>

  <p>Looking at this list, it’s easy to see why market validation is important if you want your startup to succeed. Yet these fundamental questions often go unanswered with more than a hunch.</p>

  <p>In our <strong><a href="https://www.belighted.com/blog/ultimate-checklist-developing-new-software-product">Power Checklist</a></strong>, we outline several market validation steps you should complete before and while building your product.</p>

  <h2>Market validation to determine focus</h2>

  <p>When we say ‘fail fast’, we mean to find out the things that don’t work so you can pivot away from them quickly.</p>

  <p>We recommend you compile all the fundamentals into a <strong><a href="https://www.belighted.com/blog/6-reasons-a-lean-canvas-needs-to-be-part-of-your-product-development-process">lean canvas</a></strong> for your startup. (We introduce the lean canvas tool in our <strong><a href="https://www.belighted.com/scoping-workshop">scoping workshops</a></strong>.) You will then have in front of you the major assumptions you need to validate. As you confirm them, you can adjust your strategy quickly.</p>

  <p><span style="font-family: inherit; background-color: transparent;">By shifting your </span><strong><a href="https://www.belighted.com/blog/startup-speed-focus" style="font-family: inherit; background-color: transparent;">focus</a></strong><span style="font-family: inherit; background-color: transparent;"> quickly, you can keep your team agile. You can conserve cash. And you can reach that sweet spot of product/market fit much sooner.</span></p>
