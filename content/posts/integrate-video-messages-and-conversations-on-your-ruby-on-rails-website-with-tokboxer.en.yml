  <p>Up until now, Tokbox was missing a Ruby interface to <a href="https://developers.tokbox.com/index.php/Main_Page">their API</a>. Thanks to a close collaboration with their team (based in San Francisco), we have just released <a href="https://rubyforge.org/projects/tokboxer/">TokBoxer</a> (source code available <a href="https://github.com/njacobeus/tokboxer/">on GitHub</a>), a Ruby gem which fills this gap. Of course, the library is still in its early stages (version 0.1.3 as of this writing), but we will obviously improve it over time.</p>

  <p>Feel free to try it by simply typing “sudo gem install tokboxer” and following the instructions in the README file.</p>

  <p>We are using TokBox and TokBoxer on <a href="https://www.istockcv.com/">iStockCV</a>, the online recruiting social network which we are currently developing.
