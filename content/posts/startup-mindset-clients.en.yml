body: "<p>We love working with startups.</p>\n<p>But if you’ve ever pursued a software development project with the founder of a startup, you know they can make difficult clients. The stakes are high. The timeline is fast. They have everything invested into their idea.</p>\n<p>Of course we very much appreciate our larger clients. Bigger companies have stability, budgets and time on their side. We get to bring the innovation. It’s a comfortable partnership.</p>\n<p>So what is it that we love about working with startups?<br><br></p>\n<p><!--more--><span style=\"font-size: 24px; color: #85ccf6; background-color: transparent;\">It’s the startup mindset we love</span></p>\n<p>For a startup founder, it’s innovate or die. Someone who founds a startup will always shoot for something extraordinary.</p>\n<p>It requires innovation, passion and ambition.</p>\n<p>We are <strong><a href=\"/about\" target=\"_blank\">at our core</a></strong> a group of developers, analysts, and designers. But we are not here to just clock in and make a living. There is a whole layer of thinking that comes before the technical work. We listen to the customer who has this disruptive idea and imagine with them how it can become a product.</p>\n<p>We convert their ideas into something that is programmable, something that has a real use.</p>\n<p>We love that we work directly with the decision maker: the CEO, CMO or <strong><a href=\"/blog/do-you-really-need-to-hire-a-cto-to-launch-your-startup\" target=\"_blank\">CTO</a></strong>. Our team thrives on the energy and passion they bring. We know the stakes are high for them, and it inspires us to care, to invest ourselves too.</p>\n<p>We’ve had the opportunity to work with <strong><a href=\"/case-studies\" target=\"_blank\">some really amazing startups</a></strong>, helping them launch or improve products that you may even be using today.</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">We want to change the world with our clients</span></h1>\n<p>Sure, you can find innovation at bigger companies. But you’ll also find bureaucracy. Decisions have to go through more people, and politics come into play.</p>\n<p>For a startup founder, the work is more than a job. It’s life. They pour themselves into it, it’s their passion. They set out to change the world, and most fund it from their own pockets. They have assembled a small team and are lean and hungry.</p>\n<p>A startup can start from nothing and build something that will make a difference, or disrupt something that’s not as good as it could be. They improve quality of life for people.</p>\n<p>That’s what excites us about working with the startup founders who come to us. Belighted wants to change the world alongside its clients.</p>\n<p>Our team is cultivated of people who embrace the startup mindset and culture. We are as proud of our team as we are of our clients.
