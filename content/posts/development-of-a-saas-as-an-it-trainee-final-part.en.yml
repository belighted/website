This is making me realize how much Belighted made me progress.</p>\n<p>Let's now talk about what I did and learnt during these last weeks.</p>\n<h2>Implementing Pravatar on Scale</h2>\n<p>Scale is one of Belighted's project.<br>It's a resource managment system <strong><a href=\"https://www.belighted.com/saas-guide-to-software-as-service\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SaaS </a></strong>designed for digital agencies.</p>\n<p>Scale has no avatar management except Gravatar, this is what led to the idea of Pravatar.<br>That idea is providing Scale with a separate avatar system, then re-use it on other projects needing avatars, and eventually making it available for external projects.</p>\n<p>So once I made Pravatar working, and tested it on an other project including the dedicated <strong>gem</strong> and javascript <strong>snippet</strong>, it was the time to make the final test, running Pravatar on Scale !</p>\n<h3>The available tools</h3>\n<p>During this work on Pravatar, I built these tools in order to make clients able to use the services :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>API</strong> : An API following the JSON API specification.</li>\n<li><strong>Script</strong> : Included in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag by the client, which can then use Pravatar feature simply by using some <code>data-purpose</code> attributes in the HTML.</li>\n<li><strong>Gem</strong> : Working alongside the script, the gem is simplifying the process a step further, providing two simple, concise and configurable helpers for displaying and uploading Pravatar features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Equipped with these tools, next step was to discover Scale codebase and figure out how to set up Pravatar.</p>\n<h3>Scale analysis</h3>\n<p>At first glance, Scale quite frightened me because it was something I never saw before.<br>I was expecting some simple Rails structure with just an app folder containing the <code>mvc</code> folders and nothing more, so I could just insert the snippet in the classic <code>application.html.erb</code> file, then put the gem in the gemfile and raise my hand telling I was finished with this.<br>How naive was I ! However, looking at it today, I'm <strong>so much</strong> more satisfied that it hasn't been that easy.</p>\n<p>So, Scale was in fact an <em>AngularJS</em> single-page app served by the Rails backend app.<br>I didn't understand how exactly AngularJS is running with Rails in Scale, but I quickly understood that I would have to work only with Angular. So I took some days to learn Angular after analyzing the code.</p>\n<h3>The tools and Scale</h3>\n<p>Equipped with my new knowledge of AngularJS, I was able to review the usability of my tools inside the project.</p>\n<h4>Javascript Snippet</h4>\n<p>The main problem with my snippet was that I based all the functionnalities on the <code>$document.ready()</code> event, which was fine with a \"stateless\" web-app like my Rails demo, but totally <strong>not</strong> with an Angular \"stateful\" one !</p>\n<p>So I updated that script by providing my functionnality inside a <em>Pravatar</em> object attached to the <code>window</code> by the script.<br>But it didn't worked well anyway, moreover it seemed quite ugly to me to mix up my script with angular and brutalize its logical process with my functions.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the snippet wasn't designed for that kind of project.<br>Even if I would have been able to make it work with Angular, I'm still not sure about how good it would have been.</p>\n<h4>The Rails Gem</h4>\n<p>My failure with the snippet was implying that I could not use the gem, because it was designed to work alongside it !</p>\n<p>Anyway, even if the snippet would have been totally fine, the gem would have been constituing a source of issues.</p>\n<p>The Pravatar gem has <code>JWT gem</code> as a dependency.<br>Trying to <code>bundle install</code> Pravatar gem on Scale led to a monumental amount of <strong>sub-dependecies versions conflicts</strong>, solving these conflicts by upgrading these dependencies could have made Scale totally unstable for whichever gem version update.</p>\n<h4>Pravatar API</h4>\n<p>This was the only option left to make Pravatar works on Scale, and probably the <strong>best</strong>.</p>\n<p>If I managed to build a script using this API to run the service, the thing was totally achievable by using that API with AngularJS despite my lack of experience and my brand-new newbie knowledge about it.</p>\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\n<p>The only parts of Scale that I had to focus onto were the avatars.</p>\n<p>As the avatars were only displayed (no update/upload options), I rapidly found out that all of the avatar displays on Scale were achieved by the same <code>directive</code>.</p>\n<p>In order to use my Pravatar API, I had to build a <code>PravatarProvider</code> which would be initialized with the <em>apiKey</em>, the <em>projectName</em> and the <em>pravatarUrl</em>.<br>This provider would then expose two functions, a <code>load</code> one for loading the avatar from a profile id, and an <code>upload</code> one for uploading a new avatar with base64 image data and the profile's id.</p>\n<p>As the display zone for avatars was perfectly designed, the result of a fetched Pravatar was marvelously fitting in it.<br>As the upload function wasn't implemented before, it took me a bit of time to design something intuitive for the users.<br>But with the advice of Simon, and re-using some <em>loading-effect</em> element of Scale, I managed to achieve a stylish upload feature on Scale.</p>\n<p>Like usual, it seems really simple now, but it took me some time to figure out how Angular was working and become confident with it.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>These fifteen weeks were really awesome, so much new experience and stuff to learn, some beers with the Belighters, being happy to go there every day !</p>\n<p>I really hope that the Pravatar stuff will be useful to Belighted in some ways and that I achieved good work for them, as they gave me a lot in counterpart.</p>\n<p>That experience confirmed my will to pursue in the web development area, and I feel really lucky to have made that internship in such a good company wich such nice people.</p>\n<p>Thank you again Belighted !<br><!--HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --><span class=\"hs-cta-wrapper\" id=\"hs-cta-wrapper-fb3606cc-cc1b-47d0-ae85-2c9f69837fe2\"><span class=\"hs-cta-node hs-cta-fb3606cc-cc1b-47d0-ae85-2c9f69837fe2\" id=\"hs-cta-fb3606cc-cc1b-47d0-ae85-2c9f69837fe2\"><!--[if lte IE 8]><div id=\"hs-cta-ie-element\"></div><![endif]--><a href=\"https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/1684659/fb3606cc-cc1b-47d0-ae85-2c9f69837fe2\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"hs-cta-img\" id=\"hs-cta-img-fb3606cc-cc1b-47d0-ae85-2c9f69837fe2\" src=\"https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/1684659/fb3606cc-cc1b-47d0-ae85-2c9f69837fe2.png\" alt=\"New Call-to-action\"></a></span></span><!-- end HubSpot Call-to-Action Code --></p>\n</span>"
