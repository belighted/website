body: "We wanted to build a new version of our learning management software, and Belighted convinced us to do a design sprint together before jumping into development itself. This helped us make much more informed decisions on what we needed, and how best to do it. In the end, it allowed us to better prioritise our project, and prevented us from going in the wrong direction."
