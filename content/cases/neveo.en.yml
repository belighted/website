An alternative way of developing the product was required. <strong>They believe that it was not essential for a founder to have a technical background</strong>.</p>\n<p>In fact, this might have caused the founders to spend more time prioritizing the development of the software instead of finding a market for this product. Building a marketing and business strategy is actually just as important, if not more important, than the product itself during these first few months. <strong>Wanting to concentrate fully on the unleashing of their business, either they had to recruit another developer or outsource the development of the product to an outsourcer who would assume complete responsibility for product development and architecture:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>We were always running behind schedule with development. There was a lack of expertise and we became severely behind schedule but we told ourselves that we had to hire a contractor that could put several people to work on the project for a short period of time in order to complete development and to focus on the business. That cost us a considerable amount of money in one year (...) Was that how things were going to continue, with no certainty of having a tested product?”<br></em><strong>- Vincent Leroy, CEO of Neveo</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Criteria to chose a software house</h3>\n<h4><strong>Proximity</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>Where<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.belighted.com/blog/product-development-methodology?__hstc=753710.77c41d96abf787cf1d86369c622c6e9d.1563179666846.1563179666846.1563179666846.1&amp;__hssc=753710.1.1563179666847&amp;__hsfp=1976050658&amp;hsLang=en\" rel=\" noopener\">product strategy<span>&nbsp;</span></a></strong><span>is concerned (roadmap, KPIs, feature prioritization, etc.),</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>which is the main driver of any<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.belighted.com/saas-guide-to-software-as-service?__hstc=753710.77c41d96abf787cf1d86369c622c6e9d.1563179666846.1563179666846.1563179666846.1&amp;__hssc=753710.1.1563179666847&amp;__hsfp=1976050658&amp;hsLang=en\" rel=\" noopener\">SaaS undertaking</a>, being able to discuss their ideas face-to-face in their native language<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>while challenging ideas in the same room with a local partner</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>has tremendous value in the eyes of the customer.</strong><span>&nbsp;Moreover, this speeds up of discussions on particular choices and the validation of technical specifications between the outsourcer and the customer to move ahead with the project.&nbsp;</span><strong>Seeking help from a Belgian partner acting as an extension of the Neveo team while also acting as product partner was central to the successful completion of the project.</strong></p>\n<h4>Price</h4>\n<p><span>Albeit price is always a selection criterion when you are planning to develop a project, you must understand that it is going to be necessary to spend a some tens of thousands of euros before you achieve a minimum viable product (MVP) meeting the needs of the market and winning your first customers. At first glance, recruiting a person in-house would seem to cost less but this person would likely possess very few of the many skills that a “Swiss Army Knife” contractor would have. Although&nbsp;</span><strong>having to use an outsourcer is not going to reduce your monthly<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.belighted.com/blog/saas-metrics?__hstc=753710.77c41d96abf787cf1d86369c622c6e9d.1563179666846.1563179666846.1563179666846.1&amp;__hssc=753710.1.1563179666847&amp;__hsfp=1976050658&amp;hsLang=en\">burn-rate</a>, the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) of product development will be far less than using freelancers; understanding this is essential for a startup.</strong></p>\n<h4>Skills of the team</h4>\n<p>Belighted’s in-house expertise also played a determining role in the choice of a web &amp; mobile software house to take over the product, understand its special features and the stakes for the company.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>We had a deadline that was very important and you immediately assigned two full-time people to our project and directly took charge of the entire project. You very quickly took charge of all the technical expertise of the company.&nbsp;</em><strong><br>- Vincent Leroy, CEO of Neveo</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Quickly pivot and achieve product-market fit.</h3>\n<p>In addition to developing the application, there was also the matter of the business model. Originally Neveo wanted to reconnect the generations. The concept was fundamentally the same as today’s, with the goal of making it possible for the family to connect by smartphone and computer with the elderly. They have the possibility of seeing and hearing their family using their television screen or landline. The solution presented a whole new array of technological challenges that were much more complicated today since Neveo was dependent on its technological telecommunications and TV installer partners. Albeit this project brought in a large tender for our partners, as implementation was too long and did not convey the image of a startup that the founders wanted, we decided to go back to a paper format that the elderly are well familiar with and appreciate.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>As it turned out later,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.belighted.com/blog/startup-speed-focus?__hstc=753710.77c41d96abf787cf1d86369c622c6e9d.1563179666846.1563179666846.1563179666846.1&amp;__hssc=753710.1.1563179666847&amp;__hsfp=1976050658&amp;hsLang=en\" rel=\" noopener\">quickly pivoting turned out be the right choice</a><span>&nbsp;</span>by adopting a less technical solution.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>In fact, our cooperation reassured investors and provides help with challenges and fund raising, etc., it allows us to make products on time and to test them in a timely</em> manner” <br><strong>- Vincent Leroy, CEO of Neveo.</strong></p>\n</blockquote></span>"
