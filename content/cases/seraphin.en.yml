Most companies do not master even this part themselves and I think that’s critical for a software startup. We absolutely needed to outsource the development of our project in order to find the right skills amongst these multiple areas of expertise.</em>”&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><br><strong>- Xavier Lombard, Co-founder &amp; CEO of Seraphin</strong></blockquote>\n<p><span>In fact, developing an application takes time and requires very specific skills plus a host of complementary expertise to properly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.belighted.com/blog/product-development-methodology?hsLang=en\" rel=\" noopener\">develop such an app</a>:<br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Product Strategy</span></li>\n<li><span>Front-end development (design and user experience)</span></li>\n<li><span>Back-end development (server side)</span></li>\n<li><span>Project Management</span></li>\n<li><span>Structure, framework and expertise to develop an app</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Outsourcing: Choosing the right strategic partner for your product</h3>\n<p>Although the co-founders initially contacted 3 development companies specializing in the field of insurance, they soon faced two major problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There was a potential conflict of interests</li>\n<li>Although the “look &amp; feel” of their apps was attractive, the code was outdated and, as a result, their solutions did not properly match the image of innovation that Seraphin wanted to convey</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the eyes of the founders, it was important to find a partner with the capacity to structure and to understand and who would be enthusiastic about their value proposition.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Recruiting a CEO, yes but when?</h3>\n<p>While working with a strategic partner to develop their application, they nonetheless felt the need to have a person in the company who would coordinate efforts with the outsourcer and fix any bugs that might crop up on weekends or at night. Working with an outsourcer implies, for the product part, proceeding at the pace of the company, which is not typically going to assign an employee to fix bugs outside of working hours. Having a technical professional instantly gives you a certain amount of flexibility and autonomy in dealing with the outsourcer. This is why they ultimately recruited a technical co-founder 5 months after their cooperation with Belighted began in order to eliminate this bottleneck:</p>\n<blockquote><em>When you are a fast-growing startup, there are multiple areas in need of improvement...when you work with a supplier, you have a specific budget and you constantly have to prioritize...It’s a real nightmare to have to tell yourself that you need to devote an entire day to reducing the backlog....But if you have someone in-house, you can count on this individual to be available in the event of force majeure. As you might expect, we are rapidly expanding and growing and there are decisions to be made. It is a really difficult balancing act.</em>”&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><br><strong>- Thomas Vanderstraeten, CTO of Seraphin&nbsp;</strong></blockquote>\n<span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_widget hs_cos_wrapper_type_rich_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"widget\" data-hs-cos-type=\"rich_text\"><strong>Belighted set up a structure<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and ensured that the first<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>technical expert hired by Seraphin</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>would find the<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>best conditions possible<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>for taking over the project.<br></span>\n<h3 class=\"p1\">Time to market, the lifeblood of any startup.</h3>\n<p>Note that<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.belighted.com/blog/do-you-really-need-to-hire-a-cto-to-launch-your-startup?hsLang=en\" rel=\" noopener\">recruiting a CTO</a><span>&nbsp;</span>right off the bat was probably not the best option for Seraphin for two reasons: on the one hand because it is relatively rare to find a full-stack developer with expertise in every domain; as a general rule, these professionals specialize in just one field. On the other, a CTO is also responsible for the business aspects of the application and so without help he/she would not have the time to perform all the roles required for developing an application without access to the broad range of skills that Belighted’s team had at its disposal:</p>\n<blockquote><em>If I had just arrived at Seraphin and I was expected to build a platform from scratch, it would have probably been thrown out after a few months. But in this case I was introduced to your best practices, and it’s obvious that your expertise is the result of years of project development. This gave me a very solid foundation and taught me the importance of attention to detail...I learned what I needed to know and now am able to take our particular project farther.</em>\"<span>&nbsp;</span><br><strong>- Thomas Vanderstraeten, Seraphin CTO</strong></blockquote>\n<p>In addition, the time to market aspect is crucial to a startup. In fact, a single developer with equivalent skills would need up to ten times longer to attain the high level of quality that an outsourcer like Belighted, composed of different professionals and underpinned by more than 10 years of application development experience and delivers. This is much too long when you consider that<span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.belighted.com/blog/startup-speed-talent?hsLang=en\" rel=\" noopener\">getting your product to the market quickly<span>&nbsp;</span></a>is vital for winning your first customers and avoiding getting beaten to the punch by a competitor who is faster on his feet.</p></span>"
