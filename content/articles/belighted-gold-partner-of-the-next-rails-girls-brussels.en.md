Remember the first Belgian edition initiated in 2012 by Belighted ... Much has been accomplished by Rails Girls since its creation in 2010 in Helsinki. Enthusiasm is such that sessions now take place around the world: London, Miami, Chicago, Kyoto, Beijing, Sydney, Buenos Aires ...

Remember that the purpose of Rails Girls is to **open technology to women**, making it more accessible to them, so that they can take part in the construction of the web. Concretely, the aim is to **introduce them freely to web development techniques with Ruby on Rails**.

You too, come take your first steps into the world of programming and learn to code during this fantastic experience. Why hesitate? No prior knowledge is required and registration is free.

The next edition of Rails Girls Brussels will take place the **8th & 9th of May** at Betacowork Coworking. Registration deadline April 23.
