In 2008, on the university campus at Louvain-la-Neuve, Nicolas Jacobeus made his vision reality. He founded Belighted, a software development agency, to create innovative products that would delight users.

From the start, Belighted embraced excellence in modern, efficient technologies like Ruby and its web framework Rails. Relentless focus on quality helped Belighted grow and attract like-minded talent, and the company is now a passionate team of software engineers, user experience specialists, and project managers.

Belighted has helped dozens of software innovators across Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Germany and the United Kingdom grow their vision from idea to success. We have earned a reputation for working hand-in-hand with companies to build products on the frontlines of innovation. And we continue to push the envelope of innovation with our own R&D projects.

We believe in changing the status quo and improving the quality of life for fellow humans with software. Come join us on our journey of self-actualization and lifelong learning.

Prepare to Be Delighted.
