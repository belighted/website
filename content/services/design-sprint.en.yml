      <p>As we will build your prototype <strong>together</strong>, we expect from our clients to attend the first 3 days. If possible, attending the User Testing on Friday is recommended. If one person of your company can only attend one day, it should be on Monday when we tackle your problem and how we could solve it. <br /><br /><strong>The only prerequisite is to own a product roadmap.</strong> Otherwise, we can''t jump into design yet. If you don''t have one yet, don''t worry, we can make one for you in what we call a <a href="/services/strategy-workshop">strategy workshop</a>.</p>
