One of their developers supported by their product manager came and only 3 weeks later one project was already done. No time was wasted on onboarding, they were rapidly operational and a part of our agile scrum environment. Moreover, the value delivered in terms of product &amp; software development expertise was very much appreciated by our technical team.”
