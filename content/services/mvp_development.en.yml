Based on the lean startup methodology, we only build the minimum amount of required features to acquire early adopters. This is what we call a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The features to prioritize are chosen based on our design sprint's user stories &amp; user testing feedback.</p><h3>The clock's ticking</h3><p>The longer you hold on to your idea, the higher the risk that your competitors will beat you to it. You could hire in-house developers or a freelancer to build your software product for you...</p>                                                                                                            <i></i>                                                    Get Started                                                    Really Fast                                            <h3>Reduce Time to Market </h3><p>...but it takes time to find someone with the right mix of skills for your specific product. Can you afford the <strong>risk of</strong> losing valuable time &amp; money on<strong> building the wrong application ?</strong></p>"
