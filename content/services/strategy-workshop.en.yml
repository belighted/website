One of their developers supported by their product manager came and only 3 weeks later one project was already done. No time was wasted on onboarding, they were rapidly operational and a part of our agile scrum environment. Moreover, the value delivered in terms of product &amp; software development expertise was very much appreciated by our technical team.”\n    \n     \n      \n          \n              \n          \n      \n      \n          <p><strong>Olivier Simonis</strong><br />CEO, Qualifio</p>\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        “It's a real pleasure to work with Belighted.

This helped us make much more informed decisions on what we needed, and how best to do it. In the end, it allowed us to better prioritise our project, and prevented us from going in the wrong direction.”\n    \n     \n      \n          \n              \n          \n      \n      \n          <p><strong>Bertrand De Praetere</strong><br />COO, Dokeos</p>\n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        “Working together, we were able to rapidly prototype and deploy a world-first insurance check-up algorithm. From the initial conceptualisation until the first live trials by users, it took us a rapid 3 months of close collaboration. Today Seraphin is still successfully using the same healthy technical foundations laid by Belighted.”\n    \n     \n      \n          \n              \n          \n      \n      \n          <p><strong>Xavier Lombard</strong><br />CEO, Seraphin</p>"
